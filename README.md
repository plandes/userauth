# Java Command Line User Authentication

This is an interface to authenticate and get user information in UNIX/Linux
environments.  This just wraps command line utilities and so that JNI, and
thus, system specific compilation can be avoided.

Specifically, this provides:
* User authentication using the [pwauth] binary.
* User full name and other basic information using the [getent] binary.

Paths of these binaries default to those on Debian systems.


## Obtaining

In your `pom.xml` file add
the
[dependency XML element](https://plandes.github.io/userauth/dependency-info.html) below:
```xml
<dependency>
