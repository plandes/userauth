# Java Command Line User Authentication

[![Travis CI Build Status][travis-badge]][travis-link]
[![Maven Central][maven-badge]][maven-link]

This is an interface to authenticate and get user information in UNIX/Linux
environments.  This just wraps command line utilities and so that JNI, and
thus, system specific compilation can be avoided.

Specifically, this provides:
* User authentication using the [pwauth] program, which is commonly available
  on UNIX/Linux machines as a package.
* User full name and other basic information using the [getent] binary.
* Can be used for the fairly simple and useful IPC/process API (`Command` class).
* Pure Java implementation.

Paths of these binaries default to those on Debian systems.  However, if the
path isn't found `which` is used to find it.  You can override the default
path with `com.zensols.unix.userauth.UserManager.overridePath`.


## Obtaining

In your `pom.xml` file add
the
[dependency XML element](https://plandes.github.io/userauth/dependency-info.html) below:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.zensols.sys</groupId>
    <artifactId>userauth</artifactId>
    <version>0.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

## Installation

The [pwauth] program is installed on Debian/Ubuntu machines with:
```bash
apt-get install pwauth
```

On Redhat/Fedora/CentOS:
```bash
yum install pwauth
```


## Documentation

More [documentation](https://plandes.github.io/userauth/):
* [Javadoc](https://plandes.github.io/userauth/apidocs/index.html)
* [Dependencies](https://plandes.github.io/userauth/dependencies.html)


## Building

To build from source, do the following:

- Install [Maven](https://maven.apache.org)
- Install [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (optional)
- Build the software: `make`
- Build the distribution binaries: `make dist`

Note that you can also build a single jar file with all the dependencies with:
`make package`.


## Other Libraries

Jenkins has a [plugin] available, which uses [pwauth].  However, it is tightly
coupled their framework, for which libraries are difficult to find.

An extensive changelog is available [here](CHANGELOG.md).
